    <h4>Procedure</h4>
    <p>Students have the right to raise any matters of concern relating to training delivery and assessment, the quality of the learning, course amenities, discrimination, sexual harassment and other issues that may arise during their course of study.</p>
    <p>
        This policy provides an avenue for most complaints, concerns and appeals to be addressed. However in some cases alternative measures may need to be explored. It is advisable for the student to contact the CEO before lodging a formal complaint, to discuss other avenues available to them.</p>
    <p>
        Following steps should be followed when making a complaint or appeal:
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 16px;">
        <li>
        The Student should firstly discuss the matter with their trainer/assessor. If they are still not satisfied, the Student may then, have the matter referred to the CEO for consideration.
        </li><li>The Student must complete the Complaint and Appeal form. Ensuring that they provide sufficient details about themselves and the course, and the circumstances surrounding the concern, complaint or appeal, who was involved, any appropriate evidence and witnesses etc.
        </li><li>The CEO will contact the Student within 24 hours to confirm receipt of this form and to schedule a formal face-to-face meeting with the student. This meeting will take place within 5 working days or earlier from the date of receipt of the complaint or appeal application.
        </li><li>The student will also be given an option to be accompanied or assisted by a support person during this or any other meetings relating to the matter(s). Meeting minutes and appropriate notes will be taken during all meetings. (National Code/Standard 8, Clause 8.1)
        </li><li>The CEO will discuss the circumstances with the trainer/assessor or any other staff member and make an informed decision.
        </li><li>The student will be contacted with the result within 10 working days from the lodgement of Complaint or Appeal form, the student has further 5 working days to respond to a formal decision.
        </li><li>A written statement of the appeal outcome, including reasons for the decision will also be documented and provided to the student via email or face-to-face.
        </li><li>A record of this written statement will also be filed in the student admin folder. Furthermore, if internal appeal process results in an outcome that supports the student, SIIT will take appropriate steps and will keep the student informed about the course of action in this regard.
        </li><li>Where a complaint, concern, or appeal cannot be resolved through discussion and conciliation, or if the student is dissatisfied with the college’s decision, they may access external appeals at no cost to them for this referral’ (refer to external agency section for more details regarding this). (National Code/Standard 8, Clauses 8.2 and 8.3).
        </li><li>
            if external appeal process results in an outcome that supports the student, SIIT will take appropriate steps and will keep the student informed about the course of action in this regard. (National Code/Standard 8, Clause 8.4)
        </li><li>SIIT will maintain the student’s enrolment whilst the complaints and appeals process is ongoing. (National Code/Standard 8, Clause 8.4)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the student has been advised that they are “Not Yet Competent”, but they believe that they genuinely do have the required degree of competency and that they have provided reasonable proof of this to SIIT, the student will have to follow the right appeal process.
    </p>
    <p>
        The process is quite simple, and is allowed by SIIT to ensure that all students are fully satisfied with the fairness and accuracy of our assessment processes, as follows:
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 16px;">
        <li>

    <h4>External Agency (for International Students)</h4>
    <p>
        If a student is not happy with the internal appeal outcome, the college will refer them to the Overseas Students Ombudsman (OSO). OSO investigates complaints about problems that overseas students or intending overseas students may have with private education and training in Australia.
