    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Complaints and Appeals Policy and Procedure</p>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Objective</strong></p>
    <p>The objective is for SIIT to provide appropriate mechanisms to its students to compliant or appeal about various
        issues during their course of study. The college will act on each and every concern or appeal lodged by the
        student.</p>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
    <p>SIIT uses a systematic approach to dealing with complaints, concerns and appeals. All concerns, complaints
        and appeals are dealt with fairly, honestly, without bias in a professional and fully documented manner.</p>
    <p>The procedure for handling complaints, concerns and appeals, is disseminated through to students prior to and
        at enrolment, we follow a process to look at complaints, concerns, and appeals and deal with them in a fair and
        equitable manner.</p>
    <p>Once formal receipt is received by SIIT, the CEO will contact the student within 24 hours to confirm receipt of
        this application. The matter will be discussed by the CEO and relevant staff and a written response will be
        provided back to the student within 10 working days from the lodgement of Complaint or Appeal form.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">If the student is dissatisfied with the decision of SIIT, they may access external appeals at no cost to

    <p>This policy is applicable to all SIIT students (local and international).</p>
