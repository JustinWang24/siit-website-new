    <p>In cases where suspension or cancellation of the student’s enrolment is initiated by SIIT, students will be notified
    and given 20 working days to access SIIT’s internal complaints and appeals process.</p>
    <p>Students may initiate the deferral, suspension and cancellation of enrolment, including granting of a leave of
    absence during the course through formal agreement on the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>compassionate or compelling circumstances</li>
        <li>where students do not receive their visa in time</li>
        <li>serious illness or injury – where a medical certificate states the student was unable to attend classes.</li>
        <li>bereavement of close family members</li>
        <li>major political upheaval or natural disaster in home country</li>
        <li>a traumatic experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note: Deferring to go home to be married or attend the wedding of a family member is not considered to
    be compassionate or compelling circumstances which is beyond the control of the student.</p>
