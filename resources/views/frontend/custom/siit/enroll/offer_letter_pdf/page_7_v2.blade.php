    <h3>Student Academic Progress and Attendance</h3>
    <p>As part of the Orientation session, you will be provided with a training schedule which you will follow in order to ensure completion of the course within the timeline we have agreed on. Please, ensure you familiarize yourself with the schedule and due dates of your assessments.
    </p>
    <p>SIIT will follow the Department of Immigration and Border Protection policy and procedure for systematically monitoring students’ course progress. SIIT will be proactive in notifying and counselling students who are at risk of failing to meet course progress requirements. SIIT will report students, under section 19 of the ESOS Act, who have breached the course progress requirements.</p>
    <p>SIIT believes that regular and sufficient class attendance is necessary for successful achievement of expected outcomes in VET.</p>
    <p>Therefore, SIIT will also record and monitor students’ class attendance, and may remind students of their student visa responsibilities.</p>
    <p>You are expected to attend 20 hours of training per week (15 hours classroom delivery and a minimum of 5 hours of online learning).</p>
    <p>
        <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">It is your responsibility to attend a minimum of 80% of classes</strong> to ensure you absorb all the information provided by the trainers as per the course schedule. Trainers will not interrupt the session flow to provide students with individual tuition due to the student not attending classes. Should it be required, the student should endeavour to catch up with the information taught in class by consulting with the trainer outside training sessions or by working together with other students on projects or in their own time.
    </p>
    <p>You can find SIIT’s Course Progress and Intervention policy in our Student Handbook advising students of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        the requirements for achieving satisfactory course progress

        </li><li>intervention strategies that will be implemented for students at risk of failing to achieve satisfactory course progress
        </li><li>the process for determining the point at which the student has failed to meet satisfactory course progress; and
        </li><li>procedures for notifying students that they have failed to meet satisfactory course progress requirements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>SIIT will make this policy and intervention strategy available to staff as well and will induct trainers and student support service staff appropriately.</p>
    <p>
        SIIT will identify and contact students at risk of not meeting the course progress and attendance requirements by contacting them via email/telephone/letter, as deemed fit.</p>
    <p>A copy of the Course Progress and Intervention Policy and Procedure can be found also on our website at the following link: {{ url('/page/assessments-and-policy') }}</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Assessments (due dates and late submissions)</h3>

It is vital that you submit your assessments on or before the due date to allow time for marking, review and feedback from the trainer/assessor.
