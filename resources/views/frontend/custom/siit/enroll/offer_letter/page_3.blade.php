    <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Policy</strong></p>

    <p>An application for refund of fees paid must be done by the student in writing. This form may be submitted electronically, in person or by mail. A copy of refund application form is available on SIIT website or can be collected from SIIT Student Services Officer. Students who are off-shore or interstate can contact SIIT at <a href="mailto:{{ $siteConfig->contact_email }}">{{ $siteConfig->contact_email }}</a> regarding any refunds.</p>
