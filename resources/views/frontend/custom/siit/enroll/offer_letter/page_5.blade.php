    <p>Refund – Provider Default
    <p>In the unlikely event that SIIT is unable to deliver the course in full, the student will be offered a refund of all the course fees they have paid to date. The refund will be paid to the student within 2 weeks of the day on which the course ceased being offered/provided.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, the student may be offered enrolment in another course/qualification by SIIT at no extra cost to the student.</p>
    <p>The student has the right to choose whether they would prefer a refund of the unused portion of the tuition fee (calculated according to the percentage of training and assessment already completed against the total duration of the qualification), or to accept a place in another course.</p>
    <p>If the student chooses placement in another course, SIIT will ask the student to sign a document to indicate that they accept the placement.</p>
    <p>For international students, if SIIT is unable to provide a refund or place the student in an alternative course, SIIT’s Tuition Protection Service (TPS) will place the student in a suitable alternative course at no extra cost to the student.</p>
    <p>If the ESOS Assurance Fund Manager cannot place the student in a suitable alternative course, the student will be eligible for a refund as calculated by the Fund Manager.</p>
