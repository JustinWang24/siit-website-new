        <li style="font-weight: bold;">If an international student chooses to access SIIT's complaints and appeals processes, that SIIT
            will maintain the student’s enrolment whilst the complaints and appeals process is ongoing.</li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">If the internal or external complaint handling or appeal process results in a decision that supports
            the student, SIIT will immediately implement any decision and/or corrective and preventative
            action required.</li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Where an international student has chosen not to access the complaints and appeals processes
            within the 20 working day period, withdraws from the process, or the process is completed and
            results in a decision supporting SIIT, that SIIT will notify the Secretary of Department of
            Education and Training through PRISMS of the student not achieving satisfactory course
            progress or not meeting attendance requirements as soon as practicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure</p>
    <p>Students have the right to raise any matters of concern relating to training delivery and assessment, the quality
        of the learning, course amenities, discrimination, sexual harassment and other issues that may arise during their
        course of study.</p>
    <p>SIIT uses a systematic approach to dealing with complaints, concerns and appeals. All concerns, complaints
        and appeals are dealt with fairly, honestly, without bias in a professional and fully documented manner.</p>
    <p>This policy provides an avenue for most complaints, concerns and appeals to be addressed. However in some
        cases alternative measures may need to be explored. It is advisable for the student to contact the CEO before
        lodging a formal complaint, to discuss other avenues available to them.</p>
    <p>Following steps should be followed when making a complaint or appeal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Student should firstly discuss the matter with their trainer/assessor. If they are still not satisfied, the
            Student may then, have the matter referred to the CEO for consideration.</li>
        <li>The Student must complete the Complaint and Appeal form. Ensuring that they provide sufficient details
            about themselves and the course, and the circumstances surrounding the concern, complaint or appeal,
            who was involved, any appropriate evidence and witnesses etc.</li>
        <li>The CEO will contact the Student within 24 hours to confirm receipt of this form and to schedule a formal
            face-to-face meeting with the student. This meeting will take place within 5 working days or earlier from
            the date of receipt of the complaint or appeal application.</li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">The student will also be given an option to be accompanied or assisted by a support person
            during this or any other meetings relating to the matter(s). Meeting minutes and appropriate notes
            will be taken during all meetings. (National Code/Standard 8, Clause 8.1)</li>
        <li>The CEO will discuss the circumstances with the trainer/assessor or any other staff member and make
            an informed decision.</li>
        <li>The student will be contacted with the result within 10 working days from the lodgement of Complaint or
            Appeal form, the student has further 5 working days to respond to a formal decision.</li>
        <li>A written statement of the appeal outcome, including reasons for the decision will also be documented
            and provided to the student via email or face-to-face.</li>
        <li>A record of this written statement will also be filed in the student admin folder. Furthermore, if internal
            appeal process results in an outcome that supports the student, SIIT will take appropriate steps and will
            keep the student informed about the course of action in this regard.</li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Where a complaint, concern, or appeal cannot be resolved through discussion and conciliation,
            or if the student is dissatisfied with the college’s decision, they may access external appeals at
            no cost to them for this referral’ (refer to external agency section for more details regarding this).
            (National Code/Standard 8, Clauses 8.2 and 8.3).</li>
